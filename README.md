# E-Library Hub
The E-Library Hub initiative is based on the ideas of empowerment, equity, and accessibility in learning and information sharing. In the current digital era, having access to knowledge is a basic human right rather than merely a privilege. Nevertheless, there are still a lot of obstacles to overcome, especially for underprivileged groups and people who have little access to traditional educational settings like libraries. By offering a centralized platform where users can freely access a wide range of educational materials, independent of their geography, socioeconomic level, or institutional affiliation, while still adhering to norms and regulations. E-Library Hub aims to solve these inequities.
